In sept-2022, I have spent a month swimming in 42-Paris hectic ```piscine```. 

Subsequently, I have been enrolled there for a 12-month curriculum ```42-zip```, 

where I actively participated to ```42-Paris``` campus life.

## My projects at 42-Paris school

My work led to 16 projects being peer-reviewed and validated,

39 evaluations with a grade of ```100``` and over, among which 12 were rated as ```outstanding```.

Only one C-language exam, specific to my curriculum, was validated in one-shot.
