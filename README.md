I am currently a student at [42](https://www.42network.org/) school in Paris, for a 14-month curriculum, that is called ```42.zip```.
After swimming in 42's ```piscine``` for a month (sept-2022, Paris),
I am actively participating and enjoying ```42-Paris``` life and ```peer-to-peer``` experience.

I am interested in anything related to science and technologies.
I have a background in biotechnologies, and hold a Ph.D. in molecular and cellular biology.
