I am currently student at 42 school in Paris, 
for a 12-month curriculum that is called ```42-zip```.
After a month swimming in 42 ```piscine``` (sept-2022, Paris), 
I am actively participated and enjoying ```42-Paris``` life and ```peer-to-peer``` experience.

I also have a Ph.D. in molecular and cellular biology and many skills that I have developped
during my previous career as biomedical research scientist for research organization such as
Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Pennsylvania, french CNRS and Pasteur Institute.

I am interested to everything related to science, life science, computer science

## My work at 42-Paris school

My work led to
* 16 projects being **peer-reviewed** and validated, all with at least 100% grade.
* 39 favorable peer-evaluations with a grade of ```100``` and over, among which 12 were rated as ```outstanding```.
* A C-language exam, specific to my curriculum, that I validated in one-shot.
