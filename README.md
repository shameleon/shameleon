In sept-2022, I have spent a month swimming in 42-Paris hectic ```piscine```. 

Subsequently, I have been enrolled there for a 12-month curriculum ```42-zip```, 

where I actively participated to ```42-Paris``` campus life.

## My projects at 42-Paris school

My work led to 16 projects being peer-reviewed and validated,

39 evaluations with a grade of ```100``` and over, among which 12 were rated as ```outstanding```.

Only one C-language exam, specific to my curriculum, was validated in one-shot.

***
| language     | validated project | presently working on |
| ------ |-------------------------------------------|----|
|C| Piscine   Libft   ft_get_next_line   Exam42-zip   [so-long](./so_long_project)||
|C++| cpp_module_00 through cpp_module 09||
|sysadmin| Born2beroot   Netpratice | Inception |
|Python | ft_linear_regression | dslr |

* many of my school related repos are kept private.
